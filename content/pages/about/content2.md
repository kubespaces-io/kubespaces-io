We think devlopers should be free from the chains of infrastructure and focus on what matters: their code. We want to simplify the developer experience of adopting cloud native technologies by providing a seamless, turn-key solution that allows developers to focus on their code and not the infrastructure. We believe that the future of cloud native is serverless and we want to help you get there.
